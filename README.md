The Car Accident Detection System presented in this project aims to build a simple prototype for automotive safety by leveraging sensors and cloud-based integration to rapidly detect car accidents 
and trigger immediate SOS messages to emergency services using IFTTT. The system incorporates a vibration sensor and gyroscope sensor, intelligently interfaced with the NodeMCU microcontroller unit. 
These sensors continuously monitor the vehicle's movements, capturing crucial data on acceleration, deceleration, and angular rate.
